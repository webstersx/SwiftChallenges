# SwiftChallenges

It starts with an idea.

Create a feature branch which includes the Playground file. Branch off of that feature to develop your component.

Write your code in a class named after your GitHub account.

Give Big-O (time and space) for all functions, as best you can.

Write a function called 'run' which solves the given problem.

When everyone is ready, we start doing pull requests until everyones solution is in the feature branch.

Write code in the playground to time everyone's GitHubUser.run() command.

Merge back into main.
