# SwiftChallenges

1. When you have an idea, create a new multi-page Playground (Swift 2) in ./Playgrounds/
2. Add a problem description page, and a page for each contributor on a feature branch. e.g. /feature/primes
3. Create your own branch, e.g. /feature/primes/webstersx and write your code in your Playground page.
4. When you're finished, create a pull request to merge back into the feature branch.
5. When everyone is finished, finish the feature and merge into develop.

Your solution should solve the problem as described on the decription page.
Where applicable, identify the Big-O of your solution for time and space.
Write down your assumptions, explain your implementation
We'll figure out the rest as we go!
